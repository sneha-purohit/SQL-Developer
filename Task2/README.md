## SUMMARY

• The file contains SQL statements for a hospital management system.

• It includes INSERT commands to populate tables: Department, Doctor, Patient, Appointment, Treatment, and Billing with sample data.

• UPDATE statements demonstrate modifying patient contact info, promoting a doctor, and adjusting treatment costs.

• DELETE statements show the correct order for deleting dependent records (treatment before appointment to avoid foreign key errors).

• Finally, it runs SELECT queries to display all records from each table after performing the inserts, updates, and deletes.
